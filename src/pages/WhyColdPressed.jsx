              Cold-pressed oils are extracted using a method that maintains low temperatures throughout the process.
              This gentle approach preserves the oil's natural flavors, aromas, and nutritional benefits, resulting in a
              superior product compared to oils extracted using high heat or chemical processes.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph className="text-lg">
              When you choose cold-pressed oils from Dike Organics, you're not just selecting a cooking oil â€“ you're
              choosing a healthier lifestyle. Our oils retain more of their natural color, flavor, and nutritional
              value, making them perfect for both cooking and as finishing oils for your favorite dishes.
